# Speakers

Our Call for Papers (CfP) is now open! We are looking for speakers to share their knowledge and experience with the Ruby community.

Submit your proposal [here](cfp.html), after you've solved this:

{% highlight ruby %}

sentence = [ :le ,  :ct ]

def aXa(name)
  "a#{name}a"
end

print(sentence.map(aXa).join(" ") + "REST!")
{% endhighlight %}
