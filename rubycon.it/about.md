## Why Rubycon?

**Ruby🌊con** is a conference **from** Ruby enthusiasts **for** Ruby enthusiasts.

The name **Ruby🩵con** is a pun on Ruby and Conference and the **[Rubicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubicon)** river, where Caesar uttered the words "alea iacta est".

We aim to bring together the Ruby community for a day of learning, networking, and fun. We aim at being *nearly* as friendly as [friendly.rb](https://friendlyrb.com/), and show you some of famous Emilia-Romagna hospitality.
