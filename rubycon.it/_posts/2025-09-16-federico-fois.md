Federico is our frontender-in-chief, the mastermind behind every shade of red you see on our beautiful website!

He started working with Ruby and React a few years ago and immediately fell in love with clean and reusable code, following his keen interest in beautiful and functional UIs.

Outside of work, Federico cultivates his passion for swimming and has recently won two silver and one gold medal at the Italian Master Championships. He is currently exploring the use of AI to develop customized training programs for athletes.

What about you? Will you cross the Rubycon with us? If you love competition, you might even try to beat Federico in swimming! (Just joking, obviously you can't)
