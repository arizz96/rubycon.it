## The Die is Cast!

We are thrilled to announce the inaugural Rubycon Italia, a premier conference for the Ruby community, to be held in the beautiful city of Rimini, Italy, on **May 8th, 2026**.

Inspired by the historical crossing of the Rubicon river by Julius Caesar, we are taking a bold step forward to create a unique and unforgettable experience for Ruby enthusiasts from all over the world.

## What to Expect

Rubycon Italia will be a single-track conference, packed with insightful talks from renowned speakers, hands-on workshops, and plenty of opportunities for networking and socializing.

Our theme, "Alea Iacta Est" (The Die is Cast), reflects our commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Ruby and fostering a spirit of innovation and collaboration within the community.

## Call for Papers is Open!

We are now accepting proposals for talks and workshops. If you have a story to share, a project to showcase, or a new technique to teach, we want to hear from you! The Call for Papers (CFP) is open until **December 31st, 2025**.
