# CUJ03 Accessibility Audit Report

Based on the accessibility snapshot, here are the recommendations to improve the accessibility of the website, especially for visually impaired users.

## 1. Add `alt` text to all images

**Issue:** Many images on the website are missing `alt` text. This is a critical issue for users who rely on screen readers, as they won't be able to understand the content of the images.

**Recommendations:**

*   **[ref=e8]** `img "rubycon logo"`: Add `alt="Rubycon logo"`. **[FIXED]**
*   **[ref=e33]** `img "ruby hero"`: Add `alt="A stylized ruby gemstone"`. **[FIXED]**
*   **[ref=e69, ref=e81, ref=e94]** Speaker images: Add `alt` text with the speaker's name. **[FIXED]**
*   **[ref=e127]** `img "hotel"`: Add `alt="Hotel Ambasciatori in Rimini"`. **[FIXED]**
*   **[ref=e172]** `img`: This image is inside a button in the newsletter form and seems to be a decorative icon. It should have an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) to be ignored by screen readers. **[UNFIXABLE]** This is rendered by an external script from `kit.com` and cannot be modified.

## 2. Improve link descriptions

**Issue:** Some links have generic or repetitive text, which can be confusing for screen reader users.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Social Media Links:** Instead of just the name of the social media platform, provide more context. For example:
    *   "Facebook" should be "Rubycon on Facebook".
    *   "Mastodon" should be "Rubycon on Mastodon".
    *   And so on for all social media links. **[FIXED]**

## 3. Check color contrast

**Issue:** The accessibility snapshot does not provide information about color contrast. Low color contrast can make text difficult to read for people with visual impairments.

**Recommendation:**

*   Manually check the color contrast of the text against the background colors. There are many online tools available for this purpose. Ensure that the contrast ratio meets the WCAG AA or AAA guidelines.

## 4. Review heading structure

**Issue:** The heading structure seems to be in a logical order, but it's good practice to double-check the HTML to ensure that headings are used correctly and not just for styling purposes.

**Recommendation:**

*   Review the HTML of the page to ensure that `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc. are used to create a logical hierarchy of the content.
