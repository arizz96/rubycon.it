# CUJ02: Potential Sponsor Analysis

This document summarizes the analysis of the Rubycon website from the perspective of a potential sponsor.

## 1. Sponsor Documentation

The initial `sponsors.md` page was very basic and lacked the necessary information for a potential sponsor. I have updated the page with a more comprehensive sponsorship prospectus, including:

*   A clear value proposition for sponsors.
*   Tiered sponsorship packages with a table of benefits.
*   A la carte sponsorship opportunities.

This new page should provide a much better experience for potential sponsors.

## 2. Event Seriousness and Trustworthiness

I have analyzed the website to assess the seriousness and trustworthiness of the event. Here are my findings:

### Positive Signals

*   **Clear Theme:** The conference has a clear and engaging theme.
*   **Plausible Schedule:** The schedule is well-structured and includes a variety of activities.
*   **Good Venue:** The choice of a 4-star hotel as a venue is a strong positive signal.
*   **Professional Website:** The website is well-designed and contains good details.

### Areas for Improvement

*   **Lack of Information about Organizers:** The `about.md` page does not mention who is organizing the conference. This is a major red flag for potential sponsors who need to trust the people behind the event.
*   **No Confirmed Speakers:** While the CfP is open, the absence of any confirmed speakers makes it harder to judge the quality of the conference.

## Recommendations

My main recommendation is to **add a section about the organizing team to the `about.md` page.** This section should include the names, pictures, and a brief bio of the organizers, highlighting their experience and involvement in the Ruby community.

This change will significantly improve the trustworthiness of the event and make it more attractive to potential sponsors.

I could also suggest adding a few confirmed speakers, but the lack of organizers is the most pressing issue.

I will now proceed to update the `about.md` file to include a section for the organizers. I will add a placeholder for the organizers' information.
