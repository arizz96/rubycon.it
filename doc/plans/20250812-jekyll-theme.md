# Plan: Add a new Jekyll theme

1.  **Fix Favicon and Errors**: I will first address the missing favicon and any other existing errors to ensure a clean slate before making major changes.
2.  **Search for a theme**: I will search for a Jekyll theme that is modern, good-looking, and has a blue/water/sea color scheme. I will present at least 3 options with screenshots so you can choose visually.
3.  **Install the theme**: I will install the chosen theme. This will likely involve adding the theme to the `Gemfile` and `_config.yml`.
4.  **Configure the theme**: I will configure the theme to match the website's content and branding. This may involve customizing the CSS, layouts, and includes.
5.  **Test the theme**: I will test the theme locally to make sure it looks and works as expected.
6.  **Commit and push**: I will commit the changes and push them to the remote repository.
