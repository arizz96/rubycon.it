As a person with disadvantages, I want to make sure people creating this website are taking me seriously.

1. Do an advanced accessibility check, exp for people visually impaired.
2. Create a checklist of actions to improve the accessibility. Focus on "actionable" feedback.
   2. BAD: Improve the accessiblity in the sponsor page.
   1. GOOD: Add an alt-description in the <img src="blah"> in `index.html`.
   2. EVEN BETTER: Add an alt-description in the <img src="blah"> in `index.html`; suggested text: <img src="blah" alt="this is the picture of the event ballroom">.


I basically want to see a good return on my investment: I want to get good publicity and I dont want to be associated to people doing something potentially wrong/nasty which could incur into a reputational damage.
