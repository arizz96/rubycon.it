As a potential sponsor, I want to be able to navigate the site and find two things:

1. Good documentation for sponsors. What's in it for me? Is it well documented?
2. I need to get a gist of how serious these guys are about the event. Are they trustworthy? Is it going to be big? What's the image/reputation of these people?

I basically want to see a good return on my investment: I want to get good publicity and I dont want to be associated to people doing something potentially wrong/nasty which could incur into a reputational damage.
