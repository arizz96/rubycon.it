# GEMINI.md#

We're planning a simple static website in Jekyll for a ruby event called Rubycon.
the name is a pun on Ruby and Conference and the Rubicon river, where Caesar uttered the words "alea iacta est".

## the event

The event will take place on May 8th 2026 in rimini, italy.

## the website

The website needs to be static, and to have a minimal set of information for:

* Sponsors
* Speakers (CfP)
* Schedule
* some marketing material, loogistics, ..

## Graphics

The CSS should have some sort of sea/river inspired color set, like scales of light blue.
Ideally text will be in black or white, depending on CSS color, and have bold ins the dark red of Ruby logo (not sure what it is).

## Feedback loop

* Before executing, create a PLAN.md, ask user to confirmm, and then re-read that plan, and execute upon it.
* Use github issues to track things to do, and complex activities.
* Use meaningful commits.
