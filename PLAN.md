# Testing Plan

## Strategy

We will use the `html-proofer` gem to test the generated HTML site. This will allow us to:

*   Validate HTML and CSS.
*   Check for broken links (internal and external).
*   Check for missing images and favicons.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Add `html-proofer` to `Gemfile`:** Add the `html-proofer` gem to the `Gemfile` to make it a project dependency.
2.  **Create a Rake task:** Create a `Rakefile` with a task to run `html-proofer`. This will make it easy to run the tests with a simple `rake test` command.
3.  **Configure `html-proofer`:** Configure `html-proofer` to:
    *   Check for external links.
    *   Ignore certain URLs if necessary (e.g., social media links that might be flaky).
    *   Set a timeout for checking external links.
4.  **Update `Justfile`:** Add a `test` recipe to the `Justfile` to run the Rake task. This will allow you to run the tests with `just test`.
